# SNHU-CS-370-Project-2

The work I did on the project consists of the block of code that defines the neural network and keeps track of the wins and losses.
I was given the absics for setting up the neural network and the code to test whether it had been successful.

Computer scientist are a wide variety of people from data analysts to software developers, that use many different tools to accomplish a wide variety of tasks. This project speicifically, would be akin to a data analysts or data scientists work, using machine learning to teach a model to predict the outcomes of a task and 'teach' it to perform a basic task.
As a computer scientist, I tend to approach a problem by diving right in, then researching and learning about the parts of it that I do not understand. Although this learning method is imperfect, it has served me very well, as I've be able to grasp a wide variety of concepts in computer science this way.
My ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization are similar but not necessarily the same. As the person doing th e coding to write a machine learning algorithm, you are responsible for feeding it training data. Knowing where your training data came from and whether it is ethical to use it is important. As for ethical responsibilities to the organization, it is important to consider whether there are people that are being marginalized in favor of the profit or betterment of an organization. If there are, that is a red flag that something needs to change.
